This allows you to create a fan page like button that has none of the fancy stuff normally that exists: stream, profile thumbnail, name. Button only. Enables widget & shortcodes to make the task easier.

Want to boost your Facebook fan page subscription rate? This plugin makes what should be an easy task, but isn't, an easy one. It enables you to use a shortcode to place a small like button where ever you like without the clutter: stream, faces, count, and all of the other junk that comes with the "fan page like box" ordinarily. Basically, it generates a fan page subscription button that looks *identical* to the one ordinarily only for *sharing* a page (as opposed to actually subscribing to the page).

= Features =

* Create a like button that resembles the one that normally *shares* the current page (*as opposed to subscribing to fan page*).
* Put the like button where ever you  want using the [facebooksimplelike] short code, or an easy-to-use sidebar or footer theme widget.
* Add the like button to the top or bottom (or both!) of all of your posts and pages with the click of a checkbox on the settings page.
* Create like buttons for as many different fan page destinations as you like. 

== Screenshots ==

== Changelog ==

= 1.0.0 =
* Release

= 1.0.1 =
* Removed the __DIR__ constant to increase reverse compatibility with older versions of PHP. (__DIR__ is PHP 5.3 only. A little too fresh. Oops.)

= 1.1.0 =
* Added support for like buttons in the widgets area.

* Added a demo area to the settings page.
* Fixed bug where multiple like buttons caused things to get weird.
* You no longer have to provide the profile id! This makes things MUCH easier.

= 1.1.2 =
* Swapped out file_get_contents() with wp_remote_get(). (Thanks, [nikolov](https://github.com/nikolov-tmw)!)
* CSS file is now more straightforward, defining border color unnecessary.
