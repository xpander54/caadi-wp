# Facebook Simple Like (for WordPress)
**This plugin was made a few years ago with only two main goals:**
* Make it easier to setup a Facebook Fan Page "Like" button that more closely resembled the more simplified one used for "sharing" things on facebook.
* Experiment with creating a WordPress plugin that incorporated a settings page.

The CSS changes to necessary to actually remove things from the Like button (e.g. avatar, etc.) are pretty straightforward. 

That being said: the great thing about WordPress is that plugins for even simple tasks can get great uptake in the community because so many people turn to WordPress to *make their lives easier*. This plugin accomplishes that.

#### Todo
* Add other features like additional shortcodes for allowing people to readily make use of some of the other useful widgets.
* Continue to improve readability of code.
